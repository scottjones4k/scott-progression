##### In what capacity do we work together?
Developer in the billing team

##### What do you think my strengths are, where I shine, and what can you rely on me for?
When I'm not really sure where to direct a technical question I will ask Scott! He has helped me answer questions helping developers in other squad such as documentation on Kerry CSA's and when I worked in test Scott was extremely helpful in understanding how some of the backend systems worked which helped with planning for future projects such as building the Kerry data ahead of time. It can be very difficult to get questions answered sometimes at Sky but I really appreciate I can rely on Scott. He is always willing to offer a helping hand with anything! Scott also provided very useful contributions during CX planning, he is great at thinking ahead and considering potentially blockers which could impact timelines.

##### What do you think I don't do quite so well and can improve on?
I think Scott and the seniors handles a lot of the high level technical work for Billing and so is invited to many meetings whereas I generally contribute to ticket work, so day to day our paths do not cross too much, so it's difficult to say what else he could be doing as I think this is intended to not overload work where it's not needed. I don't think Scott should do anything differently but perhaps (if he sees the value) sharing knowledge with all devs / testers of what he has been looking into in case it could impact work when it comes to the board?

##### Do you have any further comments you want to share about me?

Scott is awesome to work with! Very level headed, approachable and good at explaining things. An asset to the team :)
