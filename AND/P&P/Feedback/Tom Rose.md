##### In what capacity do we work together?
Within Squad

##### What do you think my strengths are, where I shine, and what can you rely on me for?
Scott is very knowledgable in all areas relating to the bill, he's a one stop shop for technical queries. Scott is also the main point of contact when we relay information back to the business, he has a great ability of explaining the technical in a simplified manner. Scott is always there to help and can never do enough for you - he is a pleasure to work with

##### What do you think I don't do quite so well and can improve on?
I believe Scott would benefit greatly from a longer lead period before work is requiring his attention to allow time to review and suggest a best way forward. Although this area isn't specifically under Scott's control and is determined from PO, Scrum Master & Delivery Leads I believe Scott could lean on them heavily for a longer look into the future and what is the key next priority. It's something I believe the BAs are also pushing for and could be a good one to join up on to make sure we are allowed the time required to truly provide the correct information.

##### Do you have any further comments you want to share about me?
Scott is a great person to work with and its a pleasure to have him around - especially for all my questions!! Keep up the good work Scott and I look forward to working with you more in the future.
