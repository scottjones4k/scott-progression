##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?

Scott is an absolute super star in the billing space at Sky! He's the go to person for questions from many different areas of the business and is always happy to help and share his knowledge. Scott has demonstrated his ability to influence and inspire others and develop others on multiple occasions. An example of this is that in Digital Technology there are 2 billing teams, I recently moved from one to the other and Scott offered some helpful advice on areas I could focus my time to help both me and the team develop. He has also supported me both personally and professionally, showing a great deal of empathy and providing a listening ear when I was going through personal hardship last year. Scott would regularly check in with me and make sure I had enough support to continue with my every day work tasks. This is not something I'd expect from a Tech Lead, and I feel like it's the perfect example of Scott having great empathy and awareness of those around him regardless of how busy he is, he makes time to support others. Scott creates a safe space for Engineers to feel comfortable sharing their ideas and asking any questions/raising concerns. I've always felt comfortable being completely honest with Scott about how i'm feeling and I know I can look to him for support when I need it. This is a great sign of leadership as no matter what level you work at, people feel comfortable working with Scott and speaking up. Having this safe space, allows for personal growth and development as others feel comfortable and safe to seek help from Scott and/or share their opinions with him without the fear of being wrong and judged. With Scotts role as tech lead, he's often representing bill in high level conversations and helping shape solutions at a solution design and architectural level. I have witnessed this on many occasions as Scott then discusses these ideas with the billing Senior Engineers and we work together to come up with the best technical approaches for our spaces. This also demonstrates his strength of solving problems.

##### What do you think Scott Jones can improve?

With the nature of Scott's role and growing responsibility, I don't think he has much time to dedicate to his own personal development. At Sky we are given every other Friday afternoon to work on personal development and Scott is a huge advocate for us to protect and use this time. This is important and something hopefully he'll be able to use this time more regularly going forward. That being said, Scott is continuously developing new skills as part of his everyday job, I just think having some protected time would allow him to develop areas he particularly wants to focus on and doesn't necessarily get the opportunity with his every day responsibilities.
