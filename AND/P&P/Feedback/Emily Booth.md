##### In what capacity do we work together?

I'm the Business Analyst on JP - Digital Billing

##### What do you think my strengths are, where I shine, and what can you rely on me for?

I know that I can always rely on your opinion when it comes to any decisions that might be made about the bills. Your knowledge combined with your transparency and clarity enable us to make the right decisions - especially lately when it comes to CX/D work and I don't always have the knowledge myself to provide an informed opinion. Huge thanks for your support with charges - I appreciate I've asked the same questions about 5 times over. I really value your time and working with you, you're helping me survive the madness of billing! Thank you so much and please just keep being you :)

##### What do you think I don't do quite so well and can improve on?
I can't think of anything right now!

##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?
When I joined JP squad 5 months ago Scott was very welcoming and offering to provide a high level technical understanding of the immediate upcoming work for the squad. I felt like I could instantly rely on Scott and his knowledge to get me up to speed with the ongoing work. Scott is a pleasure to work with and I can see how his leadership skills influence the developing members of the team, by encouraging them to widen their knowledge of the technical estate. As an Analyst it helps my confidence knowing that I can lean on Scott for any technical knowledge that I may not fully understand myself. Scott is always patient and ensures that he explains the answers clearly to any any queries that I have.
##### What do you think Scott Jones can improve?
I honestly don't have a single point to add. Just please keep doing what you're doing :)
