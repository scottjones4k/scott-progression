##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?
Recently Scott has taken on a more overarching senior role across the Billing squads
which he has taken in his stride. With the introduction of quarterly planning events, Scott
has acted as the key technical figure to guide and support the delivery of numerous
features across the entirety of Billing, which I believe is a testament to Scott's
understanding of the technical estate and also the technical network that Scott has
managed to build since starting at Sky. Since moving into this role, I've been particularly
impressed with Scott's ability to not only work closely with delivery stakeholders to build
roadmaps for planning events, whilst providing technical steer on the complexity, but
also on his ability to communicate these to the squad. From my perspective, as a mid-level developer, I believe Scott has found the perfect balance between sharing the
necessary technical details and roadmap plans whilst also shielding the squad from
delivery jargon and pressures. This has personally relieved any worries I have had about attending planning events or technical discussions. Although Scott's role now involves a lot of technical planning, he has continued to advocate for best practices when it comes to design principles and coding standards. I've been really impressed by Scott's regular comms regarding design principles, where he shares a particular principle, providing suitable learning resources and outlining how the principle fits into our estate here at Sky. In addition to this, Scott has continued to be accountable for technical debt, as he did when he sat at a squad level, however, more recently Scott has raised technical debt on a department/platform level with regards to upgrading a key library shared throughout the Sky estate. I was really impressed with Scott's communication around this both at the squad and department level. Finally, I've been really impressed with Scott's commitment to helping develop those around him, including myself. During a recent squad shuffle, I really appreciated the time Scott dedicated to help me better understand upcoming roadmaps and how each feature may provide exposure to new skills to help progress my own learning and personal development. I know this wasn't just an isolated case as I'm aware that Scott often reaches out to other members of the squad around similar topics.
##### What do you think Scott Jones can improve?

Through planning I know that Scott often has to collaborate with current solution designers to establish the technical approaches that will be implemented as part of  upcoming feature work and, where necessary, provides suitable solutions through the knowledge gained talking with our backend teams. I would like to see Scott try to push some of his bigger ideas around improving, not just the architecture of Billing, but also the Sky estate our Billing apps sits in, whether this is focused on performance or reducing technical debt, similarly to his proposals for updating a key library as  mentioned previously. Automation testing is still relatively fresh at Sky and Scott has  been at the forefront of its uptake in Billing. He has regularly liaised with our senior automation tester to improve the automation testing platform in Billing. I think it would
be great to see Scott branch out of just Billing and see what influence he could have
over automation testing on a department level.
