Hi!

I hope you don't mind me reaching out to you, but it's coming up to my progression panel over at AND. I'm looking to gather feedback about the work I've been doing with you, and your opinion of where my strengths/improvement areas lie. Don't get me wrong, positive feedback will go a long way, but equally important to me is anything you can identify as areas I need to work on - it helps me form goals over the coming months on how I can move forward.

I would really appreciate it if you could spend a bit of time over the next 2 weeks (so by 2nd Feb ideally) to have a think and to fill in https://forms.gle/7XWYbDYiLrVmHFbZ6. Take this as an invitation to get yourself a cuppa and have a break while you work through it!

Thanks,
Scott
