After I went through P&P back in November 2022 with the help of my Career Scrum Team I set a set of goals based on what I needed to do to make it to the next level.  These goals were:
- Organise hacks and enthuse the tech community using the AND Wellness tool as a base
- Take part in as many initiatives as possible within the MH Champ space
- Flex mentoring skills by taking on a mentor as part of the club mentoring programme

When word came out that P&P was getting halted for a bit I took another look at what my goals were and what I actually wanted to stand for. With P&P not being an option, this basically invalidated my current goal so this gave me the chance to refocus on something meaningful with actual impact over and above just becoming a 5.2. I consulted my Career Scrum Team again and came back with a single medium term goal - [Being a Kick-Ass Tech Lead](Being%20a%20Kick-Ass%20Tech%20Lead.md). This reset my view and gave me a more targeted approach on how to work on the things that I actually needed to do to succeed in my role. Even when P&P came back, I was still working towards this goal and it wasn't the right thing for me to retarget again to make sure I'm checking the box for the next level. 

The overall outcome here was that it meant I could target [my growth](Summary%20of%20Growth.md) and actually get a lot more out of the effort I put in. It delayed me going back for P&P because what I was doing wasn't in direct alignment, but ultimately it was the correct choice for my own career and P&P would follow when it was the right time.
