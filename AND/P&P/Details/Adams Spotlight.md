Scott has recently, at Sky's request, stepped into a leadership role within Service to provide much needed oversight of the work demands coming into both of the squads. This has enabled the right conversations to happen at the right time (something Scott has been flagging for a while!) and has enabled the effort to be concentrated in the right places. This is a great example of how Scott used his insight and experience to help Sky improve their processes and their deliveries. Great job!

Additionally, Scott is a Mental Health Champion and his ability to cope with his own journey alongside supporting others with their own challenges is unbelievable. His openness about his own situation makes it easy for ANDi's to go on their own journey of discovery, which is even more impressive given that we know what a toll it could potentially take on him.

Thanks Scott!
