if i'm successful, what the plan looks like for how I will juggle the extra responsibility on client, the focus on the long term career aspect and how to be L6, with how to be visible and strong member of the dev community as well as other communities. 

keen to develop leadership, how do i do that in the PG and community

make sure i share my story, it has been a big year, dont shy away from it and own it. 

make sure i talk about all the stuff i do on sky - what am I REALLY doing on client. There's no visibility from a PG level. I am the most senior ANDi in service and have been for a year and no fires. 

club contribution - thats a big part of my story, talking about how I've shared that with people, blog posts etc MH Champ.

make sure I address dev contribution and why its been lacking - this year has been a reset year - hacking my brain
