##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?
When I joined JP squad 5 months ago Scott was very welcoming and offering to provide a high level technical understanding of the immediate upcoming work for the squad. I felt like I could instantly rely on Scott and his knowledge to get me up to speed with the ongoing work. Scott is a pleasure to work with and I can see how his leadership skills influence the developing members of the team, by encouraging them to widen their knowledge of the technical estate. As an Analyst it helps my confidence knowing that I can lean on Scott for any technical knowledge that I may not fully understand myself. Scott is always patient and ensures that he explains the answers clearly to any any queries that I have.

I honestly don't have a single point to add. Just please keep doing what you're doing :)
