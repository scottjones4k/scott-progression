##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?
Scott is very approachable and has a cheerful disposition. He is happy to talk through problems when there is a dilemma or we are struggling with something. He is happy to go away and do some upfront investigation before the squad get to a task and provide guidance on how it could be implemented. He has excellent technical knowledge.
