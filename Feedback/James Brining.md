##### In what capacity do we work together?
I've worked with Scott on Sky for around 6 months and have also been in the same squad as Scott

##### What do you think my strengths are, where I shine, and what can you rely on me for?
Scott is highly respected within both Sky and the squad. He's extremely personable and is great person to work with. Within Sky, Scott sits above both billing teams. If there are ever any questions or uncertainty about a way forward with something, Scott is always the go-to guy to discuss this with. He's happy making big architectural decisions and these are always openly discussed with great thought and consideration. He also also listens to other peoples opinions and factors these in. Scott is always onboard with any suggestions to improve things and actively promotes this within the squads. The support Scott provides these teams is great and he is highly thought of within billing. From a squad and AND perspective, Scott is always a team player. He's happy to get involved and help out with things and this is always appreciated.

##### What do you think I don't do quite so well and can improve on?
I think sometimes Scott can spread himself a bit too thin with meetings which gives him little time to do other things. This is partly Sky's fault for wanting him in every meeting though! He could push back on some of these meetings potentially which would give him a little more time back to look into other things or help out with the squads when required. That said, Scott always makes himself available when anyone has any questions.

##### Do you have any further comments you want to share about me?
I've really enjoyed working with Scott on client over the last few months. His approach to the work on Sky is both refreshing and motivating and I feel like I've learnt a lot from him.
