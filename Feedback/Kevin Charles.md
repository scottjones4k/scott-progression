##### In what capacity do we work together?
Teach Lead / Career coach

##### What do you think my strengths are, where I shine, and what can you rely on me for?
I've worked with Scott in Sky over a period of just over a year & for the last 6+ months he's been working in the role of a tech lead within Sky supporting both of the billing squads.

###### Leadership & Technical Lead
Scott is the point of contact for both billing squads for larger technical direction & decisions - all members of the team know they can go to him for clarity on a number of questions including:
- Solution design in the frontend
- The correct services to use
- Technical compliance
- Security related concerns

A regular comment from those on the team is "I will speak to Scott and get X" or "Scott has looked in to this for me and Y".

He works closely with the tech leadership team within Sky (Tech Leads, Principal Engineers & Architects) to plan & align the work we have coming down to use typically months in advance of use doing it. He has excelled at this and because of his work the team are much better equipped to know how to handle the work that is coming by him sharing his knowledge with the squad seniors.

I have felt the impact of this in the day to day work in the team & we are able to get through much more work without being affected by blockers.

###### Coaching
Scott has been my career coach throughout my time at Adams & I have grown a great deal through his direct input / advice but also observing how he works on a day to day basis at Sky.

Scott has successfully helped me achieve 2 successfully P&P promotions from 3.3 => 4.1 then 4.1 => 4.2.

More recently in my coaching catch ups with Scott we've gone with 2 types of catch up:
- General career catchups / direction chats
- An overview of his role & in depth discussions on some of the things he's worked on

In particular our discussions on his role & some of his work have been great as it's allowed be to ask how he goes about something & learn directly about his approach. I'm looking forward to more discussions about the details of his work!

##### What do you think I don't do quite so well and can improve on?
Feel free to also suggest specific tasks I can do to improve something if you have anything in mind

Nothing immediately comes to mind to "improve" specifically. I think it might be useful for you to regularly remind the squads what they can reach out to you for - for new joiners / more shy team members specifically.

##### What impressed you about Scott Jones's performance?
I've worked with Scott in Sky over a period of just under a year & more recently he has
taken on the role of a tech lead within Sky. In this role Scott serves as the technical point  of contact for both billing squads (approx 15 devs / 7 test), he represents us in higher level technical discussion & decisions within Sky
###### Technical Expertise
Scotts technical expertise is apparent from my many interactions with him, he has taken on some of the most challenging & impactful work the squad has had to complete including: -debugging and determining the cause of a memory leak issue that prevented the team from moving to node 18 - planning an upgrade path that allows us to use 2 versions of apollo to ease the transition - being heavily involved in the planning of the up coming work for the Republic of Ireland mobile bill Scott is also a regular point of contact for many on the team for either in depth technical review or assistance with technical work
###### Leadership & Communication Skills
Taking on a tech lead role for the billing squads at sky has meant that Scott is in regular contact with higher level stakeholders and many of the other teams we depend on. More recently Scott has been working closely with developers from the backend team and some of their solutions architects. In these calls he represents both billing squads by taking our requirements, concerns and questions to the relevant stakeholders to make sure they are understood and dealt with. I think Scotts taking lead in this capacity has meant that the squad have run into far less blocking issues, as usually they have been spotted & handle handled by him or relevant parties. I also believe Scott has personally been instrumental in pushing for this more direct line of communication between our frontend and the backend teams, this is a dramatic change compared to how teams functioned before. This change in communication style I feel has meant that we have been able to tackle the ROl mobile bill with more confidence that our concerns & queries are being communicated effectively
###### Coaching
Working with Scott has been instrumental in my journey towards growing into a more senior developer. As my career coach Scott has successfully helped me achieve 2 successfully P&P promotions from 3.3 => 4.1 then 4.1 => 4.2. His guidance has gone beyond just how to develop technical prowess; he's equipped me with how to grow my leadership skills, how to convince / influence others, bigger picture thinking and a better understanding of industry dynamics that are crucial for more advanced positions. He's also helped prompt me with the correct questions to figure out what direction I see my career path unfolding in and in general very actionable feedback & advice. All around a great career coach :)

I feel like the typical setup of a Sky squad does not give him the opportunity to flex &
develop his skills as a line manager
